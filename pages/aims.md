# Our aims

 - We hope to help people to see what happens when they give to charity, bringing to life their donations.
 - We want people to be open and proud about what they have achieved with their charitable giving, and be willing to share it freely with their friends, rather than hiding their philanthropic light under a bushel (but if you want to hide under a bushel, thatâ€™s cool too!)
 - We hope that people will give more to charity as a result of all this.
