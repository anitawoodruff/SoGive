		<H4>7. Processing of donations and Gift Aid</H4>
		<p style="text-align:justify; color:#777; font-size:14px;">
			<ol>
				<li>
					Every charity that is a member of SoGive has an agreement with SoGive authorising it to facilitate donations on its behalf. SoGive also enables the charities to claim Gift Aid by gathering the Gift Aid declarations necessary to make this happen. SoGive then passes this information on to the charities to enable them to claim Gift Aid. Charities must be registered with the Charity Commission or exempt from registration for SoGive to pass on this information. SoGive may also feature certain not-for-profit and other organisations, which are not eligible for Gift Aid reclaim. Such organisations are indicated on the SoGive site as not eligible for Gift Aid reclaim. Donations to any of these Causes are not tax deductible
				</li>
				<li>
					SoGive also runs a "non member charity" service. This means SoGive may also feature on our Website charities registered with the Charity Commission for England and Wales, even if they are not one of our member charities
				</li>
				<li>
					When SoGive sends a donation to a non member charity, SoGive will send the non member charity the donation plus the Gift Aid declaration information to enable them to claim Gift Aid. If the non member charity accepts the donation and receives the Gift Aid declaration information an agreement will be formed with SoGive. If they do not accept the cheque or the Gift Aid declaration information they will not enter into any agreement with SoGive and the donation will not be processed. It may take up to six months from when SoGive passes your donation on to the charity to confirm that the donation will not be processed. If the non member charity refuses the donation, SoGive is unable to make payment or doesn't feel it is appropriate to pass on a donation (for example, if a charity has been de-registered by the Charity Commission or has a sanction listed against them) then SoGive will contact you so as to return the donation to you. If SoGive is unable to contact you then SoGive will select an appropriate alternative charity to pass the donation to
