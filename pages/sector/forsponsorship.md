SoGive is loaded with features for Participants and Administrators, and backed by our dedicated support team (here to help on support@sogive.org).

Our mission is to support charity fund-raising, so we provide the best. 
Built-in charity sponsorship helps your participants to achieve their goals, building your event's momentum, and improving retention.
SoGive is *100% free* - for you, for the participants, and for the charities (apart from credit-card fees, there's nothing we can do about those). Other sites take 5% or have hidden fees -- we just suggest donors leave a tip.
We provide confidence that the money is going where it should, which builds trust.
Clear dashboards, powered by SoGive's database of charity impact data -- the largest such database
 -- let fund-raisers see the impact their efforts can achieve.
