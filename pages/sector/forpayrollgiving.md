# SoGive Payroll Giving

Payroll giving to charity is an easy way to boost loyalty, by supporting your staff 
in giving to causes they care about. 
As an optional extra, matched donations -- where the company gives alongside the employees
 -- are a simple yet powerful way to stand with your staff. By doing good together,
 the company boosts loyalty and morale.
