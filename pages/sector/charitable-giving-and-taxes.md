## Higher-Rate Payers
If you pay tax above the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates/income-tax-rates" target="_blank">basic rate</a>, you can claim the difference between the rate you pay and basic rate on your donation. It's the same <a href="https://www.gov.uk/scottish-rate-income-tax" target="_blank">if you live in Scotland</a>. Do this either:
* Through your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns" target="_blank">Self Assessment tax return</a>
* By asking HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/reporting-your-tax-code-as-wrong" target="_blank">amend your tax code</a>
* <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Example:</span> You donate £100 to charity - they claim Gift Aid to make your donation £125. You pay 40% tax so you can personally claim back £25.00.  (£125 x 20%).

## Inheritance Tax
### A case study
1. Bob's has 3 children and an estate which has a net worth of £2m
2. By Donating 10% of his estate to charity, Bob can reduce his IHT rate from 40% to 36% on the rest of his estate
3. As a result; for a cost of only £13.4k per child, the total amount donated to charity is £167.5k
#### Conclusion
Not only does the donated portion of the estate not incur IHT, but also the rest of the estate also enjoys a lower rate of tax
