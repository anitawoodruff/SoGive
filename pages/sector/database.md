# SoGive Charity Impact Database

Our Charity Impact Database is the largest database charity impact data in the world. 
It collects together information on UK charities, and creates profiles that not only
describe the charity, but also describe their operations and impact. 
This database powers our apps with quantified impact data.

The database is available for use in other applications (under license). 
Please contact us to discuss your use case.
