			<div class="panel">
				<p class="font-18 black-font">
					The steps are as follows: select a “representative project” (more on the representative project), allocate costs to that project, determine the relevant units of charity impact (is it number of malaria nets? Is it lives saved? Is it hours of cancer research?), divide out the costs between those units of charity impact.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="font-18 black-font">
					This means that admin costs (including things like the salary of the CEO) are included.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="font-18 black-font">
					Where a charity’s way of working involves selling things to their beneficiaries, the revenues from those sales aren’t included in the overall cost of delivering those outcomes.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="font-18 black-font">
					We assume that a charity’s fundraising costs will be earned back (and then some), so we don’t include those either.

				<p class="font-18 black-font">
					We rely as far as possible on data in the public domain. This typically means data from the charity’s annual report and accounts, although there are sometimes also impact reports and other sources. Sometimes we will supplement those with requests for information from the charity themselves.

				<p class="font-18 black-font">
					When a charity does more than one thing, SoGive selects one of their projects to be what we call the “representative project”, which is the activity we use to represent that charity as a whole. In choosing the representative project, we try to make an estimate of where the next donated pound will go - i.e. what your donation is funding - although this is often a matter of judgement.

			<div class="panel">
				<p class="font-18 black-font">
					SoGive needs a way to represent charities that do more than one thing - some large charities may have hundreds of different projects, and we don’t think it would be helpful to show you all of them.

			<div class="panel">
				<p class="font-18 black-font">
					We are trying to estimate what economists call the “marginal impact” of another donation to the charity. We consider the features of the projects and estimate those which will most naturally scale as a result of achieving extra funding. This marginal impact is inevitably hard to know, even with perfect knowledge of the charity’s strategy, so the best we can do is make an estimate based on our knowledge of the charity.

			<div class="panel">
				<p class="font-18 black-font">
					We typically find we wish for more information. Indeed, in a sense, we never have enough information, since the perfect choice of representative project depends on unknowable factors. Furthermore accounts and annual reports don’t have perfectly consistent reporting formats. In the absence of perfect data, we make the best estimate we can given the information available. In some cases the data available is so scant that we can’t represent them on SoGive without getting the charity to provide data beyond what is in the public domain.

			<button class="accordion btn-lg black-font btn-accordion">Do you have to consider this on a project by project basis, or is there another way?<span class="pull-right glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span></button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p class="font-18 black-font">
					No, there’s another way. Another approach would be analyse this at the level of individual items being bought by the charity. This would make a difference to the way we calculate the cost of each thing. For example, let’s imagine that a charity includes one project to distribute malaria nets. Under SoGive’s methodology, we would allocate all the relevant overheads and admin costs (including the CEO’s salary). An alternative approach would be to ignore those overheads on the grounds that they are fixed costs and the marginal cost of another malaria net doesn’t need those costs. Further analysis of this approach shows it to be problematic, hence our choice of the project by project analysis.
