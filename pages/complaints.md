                How are donations protected against fraud and how can donors be sure their contribution is being used for its intended purpose?
                <br>
                <br>
                Donors should be aware of any risks regarding donating to an unknown bank account and have sufficient information to instil confidence that the donation will be used for its intended purpose. Information provided by the fundraising platform should include:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        What safeguards the fundraising platform has in place to protect a donor's money against fraud.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What steps the fundraising platform will take if fraudulent activity is suspected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What happens to donations in the event that the money is retained or recovered by the fundraising platform due to fraudulent activity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Confirmation that their payment services provider is regulated by the FCA.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A warning that where the funds raised do not go directly to a registered charity, donors ultimately give money to a private bank account at their own risk and that beyond a due dilligence check on the account, the platform may be unable to verify the authenticity of the cause in such cases.
                    </li>
                </ul>
