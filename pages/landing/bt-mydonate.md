# Do you use BT MyDonate?

On Monday, BT MyDonate announced that it is *closing*. BT MyDonate is popular with charities and donors because unlike other platforms, it charges no fees.
We at SoGive encourage all donors to move from BT MyDonate to SoGive, since SoGive also charges no fees. You can check us out directly on https://app.sogive.org, or read on for more.

Currently the three main fundraising platforms are

 - JustGiving -- Takes 5% of the donation as well as charging the charity a monthly fee. Makes millions in profits.
 - VirginMoney Giving -- takes 2% of the donation as well as charging the charity £150 up front.
 - BT MyDonate -- free (apart from a transaction charge). But sadly closing down.

For your new charity donation platform, you still want a free service -- nobody wants charges forced upon them. But when services like BT MyDonate are dependent on the generosity of a single backer (such as BT) it is vulnerable to being turned off, disappointing many charities and donors in the process.

SoGive is free, operating on a tip-based model. SoGive's online fundraising platform is free -- if a donor gives £10, SoGive doesn't take anything away from that £10, or charge any monthly fees to the charity. We offer the option to give us a tip if you like what you see. This also means we are not dependent on any one source of funding which can be suddenly turned off.

We at SoGive are all too aware of the importance of ensuring that every penny that can go to the charity does go to the charity. That's why we don't take any money from the charity being donated to -- we simply pass on the credit-card transaction fees of 1.4% + 20p (just like BT MyDonate).

We also provide more to engage and excite the donor, with a unique database which indicates how much of a charity's impact can be attributed to any one donor. I.e. we try to show you what impact your donation will achieve. Plus engaging images of the charity's work, logos, and a search and tagging system to help donors find charities within the cause areas they care about.

The database can be used to help you to find the charities which have the most impact -- our data can tell you which charities give you the best bang for your buck. And we also know that some donors already have a relationship with a charity that they care about, in which case the search facility makes it easy for donors to find the charity they want to donate to.

If you would like to use SoGive, simply head straight to the site https://app.sogive.org, find your chosen charity and get donating!
